This is a personal hobby project relating to my interests, which are restaurants.

The application is using a mongoDB database, which can be found in the dump folder. The DB contains 7 entries.

To start the application, run npm install inside Restaurants_App and also in public\angular app. Then, navigate to http://localhost:4200
